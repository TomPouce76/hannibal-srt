1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,209
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,355
Layers and layers of lies

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,433
betrayed by a sad glint
in a Childs eyes.

4
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:08,096
How did you feel like
seeing Marissa shore,

5
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:11,115
- impaled in his antler room?
- Guilty.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,995
Because you couldn't save her?

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,057
Because I felt like I killed her.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,442
Our friend will

9
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,249
seems haunted today.

10
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:20,590
We don't know what nightmares
lie coiled

11
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:24,111
- beneath will's pillow.
- At night I leave the lights on

12
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:25,192
in my little house.

13
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:29,420
And walk across the flat fields.
When I look back from a distance

14
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:31,448
the house is like a boat on the sea.

15
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,733
It's really the only time I feel safe.

16
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:36,889
- Children transport us to our childhoods.
- What do you see will?

17
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:40,092
Will may feel the tug of life, before
the FBI, before you.

18
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,583
He needs an anker Jack.

19
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,930
Where you going?

20
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,234
I wanna go home.

21
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,302
(Siren)

22
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:54,247
You lost?

23
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,582
Uh, what?

24
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,051
What's your name?

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,755
Will Graham.

26
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,058
Do you know where
you are, Mr. Graham?

27
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,094
No.

28
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,630
Where do you live?

29
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:15,534
Wolf trap, Virginia.

30
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:19,437
We're in wolf trap, so that's
good. You're close to home.

31
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,740
Is that yours?

32
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,210
Aw, hi, Winston.

33
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,212
Hey...

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,582
uh, can I sit down?
My feet are sore.

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,019
Why don't we take you home?

36
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:40,158
Are you on any drugs?
Medication?

37
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,125
Prescription or otherwise? No.

38
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:43,660
You been drinkin'?

39
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:46,663
No. Uh, yes. Not excessively.

40
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:49,132
I had two fingers of whiskey
before I went to bed.

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,403
You have a history
of sleepwalking, Mr. Graham?

42
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:57,674
I'm not even sure
if I'm awake now.

43
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,155
Although I may be, is it safe

44
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:16,892
to assume you're not sleepwalking now?
I'm sorry it's so early.

45
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,295
Never apologize
for coming to me.

46
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:23,598
Office hours are for patients. My
kitchen is always open to friends.

47
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,171
Onset of sleepwalking
in adulthood

48
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,508
is less common than in children.
Could it be a seizure?

49
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:39,313
I'd argue good old-fashioned
post-traumatic stress.

50
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,681
Jack Crawford has gotten
your hands very dirty.

51
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:45,452
- I wasn't forced back into the field.
- I wouldn't say "forced".

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,154
"Manipulated" would be
the word I'd choose.

53
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,556
I can handle it.

54
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:53,126
Somewhere between
denying horrible events

55
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:55,795
and calling them out lies the
truth of psychological trauma.

56
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,197
So I can't handle it.

57
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,266
Your experience may have
overwhelmed ordinary functions

58
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,301
that give you
a sense of control.

59
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,304
If my body is walking around
without my permission,

60
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,772
you'd say that's
a loss of control?

61
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,709
Wouldn't you?

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,418
Sleepwalkers demonstrate
a difficulty

63
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:23,787
handling aggression.
Are you experiencing

64
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:27,124
difficulty with
aggressive feelings?

65
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:30,361
You said Jack sees me
as fine China

66
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:34,130
used for special guests.

67
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:37,100
I'm beginning to feel
more like an old mug.

68
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:40,588
You entered into a
devil's bargain

69
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,072
with Jack Crawford.
It takes a toll.

70
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,675
Jack isn't the devil.

71
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,727
When it comes to how
far he's willing

72
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:49,712
to push you to get
what he wants,

73
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,781
he's certainly no Saint.

74
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:54,437
Sync and correction by GeirDM
www.addic7ed.com

75
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,703
room was registered to a John
Smith. Heh, big surprise there.

76
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,005
An appalling failure
of imagination.

77
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:09,008
They paid cash.
There are no security cameras

78
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,009
on the premises...
another big surprise.

79
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:14,212
- John Smith one of the victims?
- Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,

80
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,915
according to the register.
They were mutilated and displayed.

81
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,983
I thought it might be
the chesapeake ripper,

82
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,886
but there were no
surgical trophies taken.

83
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:24,121
I'm gonna need you to prepare
yourself on this one. I'm prepared.

84
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,123
Prepare yourself some more.
It's soup in there.

85
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:28,860
- Soup isn't good for the soul.
- Not this kind.

86
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,662
Alright, look, there are no
jurisdictional rivalries here.

87
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,964
The local police begged us
to take this. Where's your head?

88
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:38,635
It's on my pillow.
I didn't sleep.

89
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:41,772
Got just the thing
to wake you up.

90
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:52,180
(Heartbeat)

91
00:06:56,586 --> 00:07:00,222
(Police radio chatter)

92
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:05,193
Ok, I'm awake.

93
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,899
Hooks were bored
into the ceiling.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,734
Fishing line was used

95
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:16,405
to hold up the bodies
and... the wings.

96
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:19,074
- At least we know he's a fisherman.
- And/or a viking.

97
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:21,443
Vikings do this?

98
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,778
Vikings used to execute christians
by breaking their ribs,

99
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,914
bending them back, and
draping the lungs over them

100
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,983
to resemble wings.
They used to call it

101
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:33,220
a "blood eagle." Pagans
mocking the Godfearing.

102
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:37,224
- Then who's mocking who?
- No, he isn't mocking them.

103
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:40,126
He's transforming them.
I don't know if it was

104
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,362
a good night's sleep,
but he slept here.

105
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,764
Hair on the pillow and
the sheets are still damp.

106
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,967
He's a sweater.

107
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,235
Madness slept here last night.

108
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,406
He threw up on the nightstand.

109
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,308
Couldn't stomach what he did.

110
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,243
Flop sweat and
nervous indigestion.

111
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,412
Not nervous.

112
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,816
Righteous.

113
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,687
Thinks he's...
Elevating them somehow.

114
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,160
I need a plastic sheet
for the bed.

115
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:55,297
This is not who you are.

116
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:04,172
This is my gift to you.

117
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:15,283
I allow you to become angels.

118
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,221
And now,

119
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:22,990
I lay me down to sleep.

120
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:33,900
(Classical music playing)

121
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:53,052
A masterpiece
<i>foie gras au torchon</i>

122
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,654
with a late harvest

123
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:57,590
of vidal sauce...

124
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:02,361
With dried and fresh figs.

125
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,762
Wonderful.

126
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,764
Mrs. Crawford, your husband

127
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:09,801
introduced you as Bella. Are you
an Isabelle or an Annabelle?

128
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,903
I'm a Phyllis.

129
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:15,673
Jack only calls me Phyllis
when we disagree.

130
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:20,444
So, named Bella
for your beauty.

131
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:23,514
We were both stationed in Italy.
I was army, she was NATO staff.

132
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,916
All of the Italian men
kept calling her

133
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:28,018
"Bella, Bella, Bella."

134
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,454
Well, I wanted her
to be my Bella.

135
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:37,293
Mm. Cold foie gras

136
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:40,263
- with warm figs.
- Yes.

137
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:42,064
Very nice.

138
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:45,468
Would I be a horrible guest
if I skipped this course?

139
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,504
- Too rich?
- Too cruel.

140
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:49,038
Phyllis.

141
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,240
- Jack.
- First and worst sign

142
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:54,243
of sociopathic behavior:
Cruelty to animals.

143
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,712
That doesn't apply
in the kitchen.

144
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,548
I have no taste
for animal cruelty,

145
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:02,384
which is why I employ
an ethical butcher.

146
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:06,021
An ethical butcher? Be kind
to animals and then eat them?

147
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:09,023
I'm afraid I insist on it.

148
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,860
No need for unnecessary
suffering.

149
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:22,836
Human emotions are a gift
from our animal ancestors.

150
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:24,837
Cruelty is a gift

151
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,340
humanity has given itself.

152
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:30,577
The gift that keeps on giving.

153
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:37,217
(Inhaling)

154
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:41,053
Your perfume is exquisite.

155
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,523
Similar to the aroma on the earth
just after lightning strikes.

156
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:47,660
Is it jar?

157
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,229
That is some nose
you have there, doctor.

158
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:52,764
He really is quite
charming, isn't he?

159
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,933
I first noticed
my keen sense of smell

160
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:57,168
when I was a young man.

161
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:59,970
I was aware one of my teachers
had stomach cancer

162
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:03,074
- even before he was.
- Hm.

163
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:05,310
Wow, that must have been
some parlor trick.

164
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:09,013
For our next course,

165
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:12,416
roasted pork shank.
And I assure you, Bella,

166
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:15,985
it was an especially
supercilious pig.

167
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,896
"Death makes angels
of us all and gives us wings

168
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,099
where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's claws."

169
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,302
- Robert Frost.
- Jim Morrison.

170
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,106
Even a drunk with
a flair for the dramatic

171
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,610
can convince himself he's God.
Or the lizard king.

172
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,178
God makes angels. Jesus was
fond of fishermen.

173
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:45,965
Are we talking hardcore
Judeo-Christian

174
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,682
upsetting, or just
upsetting in general?

175
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,784
This is a very
specific upsetting.

176
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,786
Increased serotonin
in the wounds

177
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,623
is much higher than
the free histamines, so, uh,

178
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,126
she lived for about 15 minutes
after she was skinned.

179
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,494
Powder residue on
the neck of the soda bottle

180
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,663
shows Vecuronium...

181
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,633
scotch and soda
and a paralytic agent.

182
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,435
Kneeling in supplication
at the feet of g-dash-d.

183
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:11,272
Supplication is the most
common form of prayer.

184
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,308
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

185
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,909
They weren't praying to him.

186
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:19,712
They were praying for him.

187
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:25,851
He's afraid.

188
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,321
What is somebody who
could do something like this

189
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:30,723
afraid of?

190
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,880
- What's in his vomit?
- Uh, Dexamethasone...

191
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:35,314
Uh, Dexamethasone...

192
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,024
That's used for patients
with tumors.

193
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:40,365
Kepra... He's epileptic.
Radiation?

194
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:43,234
- Gamma four.
- Steroids for the inflammation,

195
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:46,471
anticonvulsants for the seizures,
radiation for the chemotherapy.

196
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,739
Our guy has a brain tumor.

197
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:54,545
He's afraid of dying
in his sleep.

198
00:13:56,648 --> 00:14:00,618
He's making angels
to watch over him.

199
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:09,296
Mrs. Crawford.

200
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:12,665
Please come in.

201
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,104
How often do you see him?

202
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,571
Twice a week at first.

203
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,573
Now usually just once.

204
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,876
You're satisfied, then?

205
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:25,912
Enough to keep seeing him.

206
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:28,514
Your intention is
not to tell Jack.

207
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:33,219
I don't see what good
it would do.

208
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:36,654
Jack sees the world
at its worst.

209
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:39,057
Don't need him
seeing me at mine.

210
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,359
He already has
too much to worry about.

211
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:44,262
He has room for one more worry.

212
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,167
I feel like
you're protecting him.

213
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:52,937
I am. I've had dinner

214
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:55,406
at your home.

215
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:58,175
You have a professional
relationship with my husband.

216
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:01,312
There's no conflict of interest,
me being here?

217
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,347
It's unorthodox,

218
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:06,250
but not unheard of.

219
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:08,918
Given the nature of your problem,
seeing someone who knows Jack

220
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:11,054
removes some of the guesswork.

221
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:18,661
This all started
as some misguided stab

222
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:21,364
at maintaining my dignity.

223
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:24,199
Nothing undignified about this.

224
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:26,435
Not yet.

225
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:29,071
But I have indignity

226
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:31,206
to look forward to, don't I?

227
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:34,443
The only indignity
I see is resentment.

228
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:39,347
Why do you resent your husband?

229
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:45,386
I resent that Jack...

230
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:47,888
Has too much to worry about

231
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:50,557
to worry about me.

232
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,626
But that's your choice.

233
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,728
Not his.

234
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:58,431
Then maybe you should see us
both for couples counseling.

235
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,002
I would recommend another
psychiatrist for couples.

236
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:06,306
I wouldn't want you to have
the home-couch advantage.

237
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,641
It's hard enough

238
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,410
dealing with how I feel
about all of this.

239
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:14,613
Don't need to deal with
how Jack feels about it.

240
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:23,989
There is no one and only
spiritual center of the brain.

241
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:26,925
Any idea of God comes from many
different areas of the mind

242
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,160
working together in unison.

243
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:31,229
Maybe I was wrong.

244
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:34,432
How do you profile
someone who has

245
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,468
an anomaly in their head
changing the way they think?

246
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:41,039
A tumor can definitely
affect brain function,

247
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:44,241
even cause vivid hallucinations.
However, what appears

248
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:47,744
to be driving your angel maker
to create heaven on earth

249
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:51,548
is a simple issue of mortality.
Can't beat God, become him?

250
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:55,385
You said he was afraid.

251
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,688
He feels abandoned.

252
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:03,225
Ever feel abandoned, will?

253
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:06,628
Abandonment requires
expectation.

254
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:09,865
What were your expectations

255
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:13,335
of Jack Crawford and the FBI?

256
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:15,336
Jack hasn't abandoned me.

257
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:18,106
Not in any discernible way.

258
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:21,576
Perhaps in the way gods
abandon their creations.

259
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:24,414
You say he hasn't abandoned you,
but at the same time you

260
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,160
find yourself wandering around
Wolftrap in the middle of the night.

261
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:31,218
Well...
This should be interesting.

262
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:34,388
Please, doctor, proceed.

263
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:38,459
Jack gave you his word
he would protect your headspace,

264
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:41,295
yet he leaves you
to your mental devices.

265
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:45,599
Are you trying to alienate me
from Jack Crawford?

266
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:50,002
I'm trying to help you
understand this angel maker

267
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,004
you seek.
Well, help me understand

268
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,740
how to catch him.
If he were a classic paranoid

269
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,478
schizophrenic, you might be able
to influence him

270
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,147
to become visible. What, scare
him out into the daylight?

271
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:04,182
Might even get him
to hurt himself,

272
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,318
if he hasn't already.
If he were selfdestructive,

273
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,553
he-he-he wouldn't be so careful.

274
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,324
Unless he's careful
about being self-destructive,

275
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,894
making angels to pray over him
when he sleeps.

276
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,967
Who prays over us when we sleep?

277
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,343
So, do you wait until you think I'm
asleep before you come to bed?

278
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,345
It's not intentional.

279
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,112
I'm working late.

280
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,049
Nothing personal.

281
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:42,302
So can we have a
conversation, or do you

282
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,487
want to pretend that
everything's alright?

283
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:47,957
Everything is alright.

284
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:51,093
So no conversation.

285
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,597
I'm a bit overwhelmed
at the moment.

286
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:59,301
- With?
- With things at work...

287
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,603
Etcetera.

288
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:05,474
I've got some things
I have to sort through.

289
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,643
It's, uh, outside
your jurisdiction, Jack.

290
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,779
You know something...

291
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,582
I'm very good
at sorting things out,

292
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,784
and at the very least
I can underwhelm you

293
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,137
while you're being overwhelmed.
You've

294
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,422
never been able
to underwhelm me.

295
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,108
Is there anything I can
offer you romantically

296
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,726
or physically or
spiritually that'll help?

297
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:28,861
Nope.

298
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:33,700
So as your husband,
what I can do for you is, um,

299
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,969
leave you alone and not ask you
any questions.

300
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:42,141
You can ask me anything
you want to.

301
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:47,814
I won't insult you by asking
if there's someone else.

302
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,484
Thank you.

303
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:55,271
You'll sort out
whatever it is you have

304
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:57,989
to sort out, we'll get
back to being us.

305
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,828
I love you, Bella.

306
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:10,569
I love you too.

307
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:38,610
(Police siren)

308
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,558
Why angels?

309
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:57,795
Well, it isn't biblical.
His angels have wings.

310
00:20:57,862 --> 00:21:02,465
Um, angels in sculptures and paintings
can fly, but not in scripture.

311
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,801
He's drawing
from secular sources?

312
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:08,706
His mind has turned against him
and there's no one there to help.

313
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,853
Uh, Jack... look at this.

314
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,646
Are those... What are those?

315
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:17,783
Somebody got an orchiectomy
real cheap.

316
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:21,321
- Doesn't look like the victim.
- So they're the angel maker's?

317
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:23,923
- He castrated himself?
- So he isn't just

318
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,125
making angels; He's getting
ready to become one.

319
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:29,561
Angels don't have genitalia.

320
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,466
So he was afraid of dying. Now he's,
what, getting used to the idea?

321
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,135
He's accepting it
or he's bargaining.

322
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:40,339
- Heh, bargaining chips!
- So, does this mean that

323
00:21:40,406 --> 00:21:42,274
he's done making angels,
or is he just getting started?

324
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,542
- I don't know.
- Well, he's not just

325
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,844
killing them when he's sleepy.
I mean, how is he choosing them?

326
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,846
- I don't know. Ask him.
- I'm asking you.

327
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:51,382
You're the head of the
behavioral science unit, Jack.

328
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,552
Why don't you come up with your own
answers if you don't like mine?

329
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:59,790
I did not hear that!

330
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:02,993
Did I?

331
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,594
Um...

332
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:10,166
No, you didn't.

333
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:11,767
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:50,504
I've never heard anybody talk to
Jack the way you talked to Jack.

335
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:53,073
- I was out of line.
- You were out of your mind.

336
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:56,443
My ears rang like the first time
I heard my mom use the f-word.

337
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:59,946
(He chuckles.) You ok?

338
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:03,283
I know it's a stupid question
considering that none of us

339
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:07,719
could possibly be ok doing what
we do, but... are you ok?

340
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,822
Do I seem different?

341
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,192
You're a little different,

342
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,494
but you've always been
a little different.

343
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,496
Brilliant strategy...

344
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,598
that way no one ever knows
if something's up with you.

345
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,699
How would I know if something
was up with you?

346
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,868
You wouldn't.

347
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:28,773
But I would tell you if you
asked me. Return the favor?

348
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,710
Meet Roger and Marilyn Brunner.

349
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,713
You might recognize them
from such lists as most wanted.

350
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,382
He likes to rape and murder,
she likes to watch.

351
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,784
We got a DNA match.
They falsified

352
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:43,353
the motel registry
and were driving a stolen car,

353
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,456
so it took a second
to identify them.

354
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:48,559
I wonder how long it took
angel maker to identify them.

355
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,372
He didn't choose them randomly.
He knows something about them.

356
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,998
The murdered security guard
wasn't actually a security guard.

357
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:57,371
He was a convicted felon.

358
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:00,035
Could angel maker be
a vigilante?

359
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:04,839
Well, vigilantes are
pragmatic, they're purposeful;

360
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:08,377
They don't lay down and sleep
under their crimes.

361
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,582
In his mind, he was doing God's work.
That spells vigilante.

362
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,085
Well, playing at God has
other advantages. One of them...

363
00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:21,989
Is always being alone. So he
makes angels out of demons.

364
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,892
How does he know
they're demons?

365
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,560
He doesn't have to know.

366
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:28,995
All he has to do is believe.

367
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:37,471
Has Jack begun to suspect?

368
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:39,807
He's a behavioral specialist.
He must know

369
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:41,809
you are keeping something
from him.

370
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:46,546
Oh, he knows. He asked me
if I was having an affair...

371
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:49,849
by reassuring me
that he didn't have to ask.

372
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:52,485
I doubt he believes
you're unfaithful.

373
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:54,420
And why do you doubt that?

374
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:57,356
It's clear you love
your husband.

375
00:24:57,424 --> 00:25:01,726
Women who love their husbands still
find reasons to cheat on them.

376
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:05,530
Not you.

377
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:08,834
Still, you seem more betrayed
by Jack than by your own body.

378
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,905
I don't feel betrayed by Jack.

379
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:17,608
And there's no point in being
mad at cancer for being cancer.

380
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:19,076
Sure there is.

381
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,946
Cancer isn't cruel.

382
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:26,049
Tiny cell wanders off
from my liver, gets lost,

383
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:28,051
finds its way into my lung,

384
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:31,053
where it's just trying
to do its job and...

385
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,255
Grow a liver.

386
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,760
What it grows and where it's
growing it will likely kill you.

387
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,229
Not likely.

388
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:42,732
It will kill me,

389
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,036
and no amount of blueberries or
antioxidants can change that now.

390
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:51,439
But you hold Jack accountable for
his inability to cure cancer.

391
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:56,244
Should I have said
his inability to save you?

392
00:25:56,312 --> 00:26:02,217
Would that be more accurate?
I am slowly shrinking,

393
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:06,120
while this tiny thing grows
larger every day.

394
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:10,658
And yet I feel fine.

395
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:13,460
You will feel fine...

396
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,963
up until the precise moment
you don't.

397
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:21,635
It's a... really very
dull story, though, isn't it?

398
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:26,973
The ending is always the same,
and that same is that it ends.

399
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:31,344
So, you withdraw

400
00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:34,514
from your relationship
with your husband,

401
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:37,082
the man who strolled along
the quays of Livorno, Italy,

402
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,785
and called you Bella.

403
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:30,833
(Dogs barking)

404
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:59,940
It's difficult to lie still
and fear going to sleep.

405
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:02,942
What is there to think about?

406
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,243
You listen to your breathing
in the dark

407
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:07,680
and the tiny clicks
of your blinking eyes.

408
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:10,549
I dream more now
than I used to.

409
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:12,417
Well, your dreams were
the one place you could be

410
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:15,955
physically safe, relinquishing
control. Not anymore.

411
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:18,456
Yeah, I thought about zipping
myself up into a sleeping bag

412
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:20,758
before I go to sleep,
but it, heh,

413
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,461
sounds like a poor man's
straightjacket.

414
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:29,000
Have you determined how this angel
maker is choosing his victims?

415
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:33,170
Well, he doesn't see people
how everyone else sees them.

416
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:36,406
He can tell if you're naughty
or nice,

417
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:38,475
or he thinks he can.

418
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,714
So God has given this person
insight into the souls of men.

419
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:46,416
God didn't give him insight;
God gave him a tumor.

420
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:52,454
He's just a man whose brain is
playing tricks on him.

421
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:56,358
You are not unlike this killer.

422
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:58,661
My brain is playing tricks
on me?

423
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:02,331
You want to feel such sweet
and easy peace.

424
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,333
The angel maker wants
that same peace.

425
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,902
He hopes to feel his way
cautiously inside and then find

426
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,204
it's endless, all around him.

427
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,607
He's gonna be disappointed.

428
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:14,743
You accept the impossibility
of such a feeling,

429
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,045
whereas the angel maker is
still chasing it.

430
00:29:17,113 --> 00:29:20,882
If he got close to it,
that's why he will

431
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,302
look for it again. I've
tried to reconstruct

432
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,653
his thinking, find his patterns.

433
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,924
Instead you find yourself in a
behavior pattern you can't break.

434
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:33,426
You realize you have a choice.

435
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,495
What is it?

436
00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:40,299
Angel maker will be destroyed by
what's happening inside his head;

437
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,401
You don't have to be.

438
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:53,112
Did you just smell me?

439
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,148
Difficult to avoid.

440
00:29:56,215 --> 00:29:58,784
I really must introduce you
to a finer aftershave.

441
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:01,352
That smells like something
with a ship on the bottle.

442
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,588
Well, I keep getting it
for Christmas.

443
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:08,160
Have your headaches been
any worse lately? More frequent?

444
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:09,494
Yes, actually.

445
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:14,065
I'd change the aftershave.

446
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:22,573
Elliot Budish: 35-year-old
truck driver.

447
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,258
He's got a fishing license too.
Uh, match

448
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:25,875
came from the national
cancer database.

449
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,945
Married, two kids... they haven't
seen him in four months.

450
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:31,081
He was diagnosed
five months ago.

451
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:33,216
Meet the angel maker.

452
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:38,788
Have you heard from him
since he left?

453
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:40,790
I left him.

454
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:42,791
And, uh, no, no,

455
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:44,793
I haven't.

456
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,329
Why did you leave?

457
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:51,266
Because of his cancer.

458
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:54,169
It makes me sound
like a horrible wife.

459
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:56,872
I'm sure you had your reasons.

460
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,110
I took a leave from work
to, uh, to be with him.

461
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:04,311
I wanted to be there for him.

462
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:07,715
But what he wanted was
to be alone.

463
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,384
He just kept pulling away

464
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,420
and pulling away.

465
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,656
He made it clear
he didn't want me there.

466
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:19,693
And then it wasn't clear.

467
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,698
And then it didn't matter why
he was acting the way he was.

468
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,903
It was weird

469
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:34,540
for the kids. I mean,

470
00:31:34,608 --> 00:31:37,042
what kind of mother exposes
her children to someone

471
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,145
who is losing their mind?

472
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:47,252
Was he ever violent,
Mrs. Budish?

473
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:52,457
He was angry.

474
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:54,259
But he never

475
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:58,025
hit me or the boys.
It was hardest on them.

476
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:02,744
To see him slip away.
He lost himself.

477
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:04,827
And they lost a father.

478
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:09,373
I thought that
as he got weaker,

479
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:13,678
as the cancer got worse,
that it would be less confusing

480
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:17,448
for them.
They could just see him

481
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:20,350
as a sick man

482
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:23,620
instead of someone
who was so terrified.

483
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:28,458
And, uh, did your husband's
faith falter

484
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,527
after he was told
about the cancer?

485
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:35,364
Elliot wasn't ever religious.

486
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:38,767
Is he doing something religious?
He may believe he is.

487
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:42,037
Your husband is dying,

488
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:45,907
Mrs. Budish, and soon.

489
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:48,944
We'd just like

490
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:52,947
to... we'd like to find him before
he hurts himself or anyone else.

491
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,751
He... had a near-death
experience

492
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:02,557
he suffocated in a fire
when he was a little boy.

493
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:07,728
Fireman said he must've had
a guardian angel.

494
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:09,696
Where did this happen?

495
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:13,066
Um... a farm...

496
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,502
Where he grew up.

497
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:10,220
- This'll be the last one.
- It's Budish?

498
00:34:10,288 --> 00:34:12,889
He made himself into an angel.

499
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:22,998
It wasn't God, it wasn't man.
It was his choice to die.

500
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,835
- His choice?
- As much as he can make it.

501
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:38,313
I don't know how much longer I can
be all that useful to you, Jack.

502
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,316
Really? You caught three.
The last three we had,

503
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,317
you caught.
You caught three of them.

504
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:47,755
No, I didn't catch this one.
Elliot Budish... surrendered.

505
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:50,925
You know, I'm used to my wife
not talking to me.

506
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:53,293
I don't have to get used to you
not talking to me too.

507
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:56,997
It's getting harder and harder
to make myself look.

508
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:59,332
Well, nobody's asking you
to look alone.

509
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,367
But I am looking alone.

510
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:03,369
And you know what
looking at this does.

511
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,738
I know what happens
if you don't look,

512
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:08,608
and so do you. I can
make myself look,

513
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:11,410
but the thinking
is shutting down.

514
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:13,580
- What is it about this one?
- It isn't this one.

515
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:15,198
It's all of them. It's
the next one, it's

516
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,748
the one that I know
is coming after that.

517
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:18,851
You wanna go back
to your lecture hall?

518
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:21,987
Read about this stuff on tattlecrime.Com?
No, I don't.

519
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:25,056
But that may be what I have
to do. This is bad for me.

520
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,092
I'm not your father, will.

521
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,128
I'm not gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

522
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:33,398
Seems like that's exactly
what you're gonna do.

523
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,069
You go back to your classroom.

524
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,571
When there's killing going on
that you could've prevented,

525
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,907
it will sour your classroom
forever.

526
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:46,878
Maybe. And then maybe
I'll find a job

527
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,413
as a diesel mechanic
in a boatyard.

528
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,050
You wanna quit?

529
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,684
Quit.

530
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,033
(Rustling nearby)

531
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,839
I see what you are.

532
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:26,475
What do you see?

533
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,844
Inside.

534
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,346
I can bring it out of you.

535
00:36:31,414 --> 00:36:33,415
Not all the way out.

536
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,084
(Cough)

537
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:41,288
I can give you... The majesty

538
00:36:41,356 --> 00:36:44,291
of true becoming.

539
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:06,679
Hello, doctor.

540
00:37:06,747 --> 00:37:08,914
My wife and I need to talk.

541
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:12,618
May we use your waiting room? You
can have the office. Please.

542
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,419
Thank you.

543
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,658
Just popping in

544
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:22,827
on official business,
or did you follow me?

545
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:25,296
I called your office.
They said you were

546
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:29,000
at an appointment.
I figured you'd be here.

547
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,504
You know.

548
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:37,208
I knew you'd find out.

549
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:40,510
When did you find out?

550
00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:42,512
Twelve weeks ago.

551
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,481
Twelve weeks ago?

552
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,385
Lung cancer.

553
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:55,357
You don't smoke.

554
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:57,626
The irony.

555
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,363
Is it treatable?

556
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,568
It's stage four.

557
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:10,739
And we know there's
no stage five, don't we?

558
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,177
When were you gonna tell me?

559
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:20,449
Far enough into the
future that I'm really

560
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,584
not prepared to have
this conversation

561
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:24,619
- right now.
- Neither am I,

562
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:27,154
but we're having it.
We're having it right now.

563
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,476
Were you just going to wait

564
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,979
until you were in the middle
of chemotherapy?

565
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:57,050
When you couldn't hide it
anymore?

566
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:59,251
I don't think I want
to do chemotherapy.

567
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:00,753
Well, do I have any say

568
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,021
- in this?
- No.

569
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:05,124
No, you don't.

570
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:11,363
Do you want to be alone?

571
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,267
I don't want you
to answer that.

572
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:18,369
Just think about your answer.

573
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:23,175
I want you to know
that I don't want

574
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,143
you to be alone, not
now and not ever.

575
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,412
We'll beat this together?

576
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,982
No, it's your fight, baby,
but I'm in your corner.

577
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:33,817
I'm not going anywhere.

578
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,189
I appreciate that, Jack.

579
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:41,825
I do.

580
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:46,062
But I'm not comforted by it.

581
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:52,334
I know that's what you need
and, and...

582
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:56,505
you need to comfort me.

583
00:39:58,942 --> 00:40:00,843
But I can't give you
what you need.

584
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:03,077
Don't worry about what I need.

585
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,951
Why wouldn't you tell me?

586
00:40:13,355 --> 00:40:17,458
I thought if I kept it to myself,
our lives wouldn't change.

587
00:40:23,198 --> 00:40:26,633
I didn't count on changing
as much as I did.

588
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:12,109
What do you want, will?

589
00:41:28,325 --> 00:41:31,460
I'm gonna sit here
until you're ready to talk.

590
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,757
You don't have to say a word
until you're ready, but...

591
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:39,891
I'm not going anywhere
until you do.

592
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:14,476
